<h2>My Superhero Origin Story</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><b>Breif Overview:</b> My superhero story is about a young football and track star who was born with a heart problem and a bone marrow issue.
When his bone issues suddenly get worse he has to get surgery to help heal his bones, but he ends up getting more than he bargained for and must learn the surgery has done to him while deciding what to do with it all.

<p style="font-size:20px"><b>The Origin</b><br></br>
“Mr. Bolton you are late again.” Oh great Ms. Willis again. “Sorry I was late I had to run to school again because my mom wasn’t back this morning.” Ms. Willis shoulda known this I mean it happens at least 2 times a week, my mom is always gone on her late night excursions with her friends and even when she’s back I have to drive myself because my mom’s to tired or drunk to drive me. “Well being the track star and football player you are you could have been here on time, couldn’t you? You always talk about how great you are it’s funny you can’t back it. Now sit down it's class time.” “Ok then Ms. Willis.” She was lying, I never talk myself up like that, sure my teammates might say stuff like that about themselves or me but I don’t, she just wants to make me feel dumb. Class goes by slow as always. I get through the day, and I’m onto practice for football.

“Aye Bolt what’s holdin’ you back in there son?! Run hard kid we got playoffs now this is about more than just you. You are “The Bolt” for a reason show them kid!” “Yes Coach.” Coach always speaks to me like that he always wants me to carry this team through games, and he always calls me by that nickname I got back in middle school when I outran the whole Puma team back in the state championship. They said “that kid can fly! Bryce is bolting down that sideline! Bolton is a Bolt” and boom The Bolt was born. Ever since then I have been getting popular and now I am the star back at New Troy Prep Academy and we are ranked 2nd in the state now. I mean we are second ranked but that doesn’t make it any easier he pushes us farther makes me run harder, run faster. That’s all I have ever enjoyed about all this football stuff it's the running. I never wanted to play football, it was my drunk of a dad's choice. I only wanted to run track to be a runner but since he was a football star back in his hometown now I gotta be one. “Bolt get back in here we are about to finish come on!”
