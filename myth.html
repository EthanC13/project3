<h2>Mythology of Zenith</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px"><b>The Creation of the Earth</b></p>

<p>In the beginning before there was anything there was the all-father Cosmo. Cosmo was vast and powerful over all and fell in love with a star and had 3 children. His three kids would be his oldest son Skyler, his second child was his only daughter Ocean, and his third child was his son Landon. Space loved his children and his eternity of life he would have with them, but he still felt it was empty and worthless and he didn’t know why. After living with just him and his family he realized he wanted something more, he wanted to be honored and praised. He then received his greatest idea, he built planets all over draining small parts of his life in order to form them. When he built Earth he said, “This is the most beautiful of my creations I must live here and make it even greater”. Once he and his family were on Earth he was hungry from all of his work, so he let more life flow into the depths of the earth and formed crops and life to grow on the Earth. They then ate and feasted in celebration of their new home.
<br></br>
When they had finished eating Cosmo decided he must distinguish power over the Earth unto his kids. Cosmo said “My oldest son Skylar I will give you power of the vastness above the land the beautiful blue and we will name it after you, we will call it, The Sky. To you my second child and only daughter I will give you power over the water that flows on your home, the Earth, and we will call the oceans after you. Lastly my youngest Landon I give unto you the dirt we walk upon, I give you power over all the ground and dirt across all of the Earth, and we will call it Land.” After giving power to his kids Cosmo knew that there should be other creatures to live and be among his children to praise them, so with his final ounce of life he created other living life forms that walked and spoke and would be able to truly praise his kids. He created a male and a female and with his final essence of life used on the male and female he slowly died. With his final dying breaths he called the people “Humans”, and that last final breath where he passed on to death, became the winds of the world, and now since he has passed the Cosmos, the all father himself, is a cold, dead place.
